# Object Oriented Programming(OOP) in Python
OOP involves creation of classes & objects, concept of OOP is to create reusable code.This concept is also known as DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself).<br>

This type of programming requires much code to perform simple tasks,hence it is better to go for procedure based approach for simple tasks.<br>

In Python, private, public, protected access specifiers are not available.Everyrhing written in the class will come under public.<br>
If we want to declare a variable as private we can use double underscores before the variable or function name(```__var,__func```).<br>

<b>Some termonologies used in OOP<\b>.<br>

<b>class</b>      -->  class is simply the blueprint of the Object.<br>

<b>constructor</b> --> Constructor are special method which are called automatically when the object of the class is created.<br>
		                   constructors are used to initialise class level variables. It has no return type.<br>
                       
<b>object</b>    -->   Object is simply a collection of variables and methods, that act on those methods.<br>
	                       An object is also called instance of a class and the process of creating object is called <b>instantiation</b><br>

<b>methods</b>    -->   Functions created inside the class are known as methods<br>

<b>Note: when we create a class, it is advised to have first letter as capital in the class name.
